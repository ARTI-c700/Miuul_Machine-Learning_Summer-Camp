Generally:
    Values which are out of the common shaped slope in the data

Can cause some problems:
"Suppose, we have initial relation based from dependent and independent variables.
It has a slope which is basically showcase relation between these variables.
If we include some additional outlying values, the relation (or connection) can change into different connection."

There are different relations:
1) Linear relations: outliers can affect more severely
2) Tree based relation: outliers can affect in small amount

HOW TO DEFINE THE OUTLIERS?
(all are kind of relating to finding threshold)
- Industry knowledge
    := e.g house prediction model can be applied only strict houses which have more than 100 m2 area
- Standard Deviation Approach
- Z-score approach
- Boxplot (inter quartile range - IQR) method

HOW IQR WORKS?

IQR - is between 25/100 and 75/100 with the following Q1 and Q3
Suppose, we have a variable age. If we look through its values in ordered manner, 25% of the index is Q1 and Q3
--------------------------------------------
IQR - Robust Distribution Scale == (Q3 - Q1)
Declaring lower limit: (Q3 + 1.5*IQR) | Higher values are outliers
Declaring upper limit: (Q1 - 1.5*IQR) | Lower values are outliers
