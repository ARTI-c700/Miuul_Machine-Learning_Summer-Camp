Note: Applied Machine Learning is basically Feature Engineering. - Andrew Ng

-- What is Feature Engineering
    := Simply, it is about operations on the features
    := Making features from raw data (this is more about feature extraction)


Processes from Datasets to Deployment :

- Datasets -> Data Retrieval -> Data Preparation {
                                                    - Data Processing & Wrangling,
                                                    - Feature Extraction & Engineering,
                                                    - Feature Scaling & Selection
                                                  } ->
-> Modeling (With applying ML Algorithm) -> Model Evaluation & Tuning - > Deployment & Monitoring
